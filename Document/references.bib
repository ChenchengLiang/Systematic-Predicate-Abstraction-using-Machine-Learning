abstract="Craig interpolation is a standard method to construct and refine abstractions in model checking. To obtain abstractions that are suitable for the verification of software programs or hardware designs, model checkers rely on theorem provers to find the right interpolants, or interpolants containing the right predicates, in a generally infinite lattice of interpolants for any given interpolation problem. We present a semantic and solver-independent framework for systematically exploring interpolant lattices, based on the notion of interpolation abstraction. We discuss how interpolation abstractions can be constructed for a variety of logics, and how they can be applied in the context of software model checking.",

abstract="Heuristics for discovering predicates for abstraction are an essential part of software model checkers. Picking the right predicates affects the runtime of a model checker, or determines if a model checker is able to solve a verification task at all. In this paper we present a method to systematically specify heuristics for generating program-specific abstractions. The heuristics can be used to generate initial abstractions, and to guide abstraction refinement through templates provided for Craig interpolation. We describe the heuristics using variable roles, which allow us to pick domain-specific predicates according to the program under analysis. Variable roles identify typical variable usage patterns and can be computed using lightweight static analysis, for instance with the help of off-the-shelf logical programming engines. We implemented a prototype tool which extracts initial predicates and templates for C programs and passes them to the Eldarica model checker in the form of source code annotations. For evaluation, we defined a set of heuristics, motivated by Eldarica's previous built-in heuristics and typical verification benchmarks from the literature and SV-COMP. We evaluate our approach on a set of more than 500 programs, and observe an overall increase in the number of solved tasks by 11.2{\%}, and significant speedup on certain benchmark families.",

abstract="We present an automatic iterative abstraction-refinement methodology in which the initial abstract model is generated by an automatic analysis of the control structures in the program to be verified. Abstract models may admit erroneous (or ``spurious'') counterexamples. We devise new symbolic techniques which analyze such counterexamples and refine the abstract model correspondingly. The refinement algorithm keeps the size of the abstract state space small due to the use of abstraction functions which distinguish many degrees of abstraction for each program variable. We describe an implementation of our methodology in NuSMV. Practical experiments including a large Fujitsu IP core design with about 500 latches and 10000 lines of SMV code confirm the effectiveness of our approach.",

The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.},
